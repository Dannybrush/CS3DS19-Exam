# CS3DS19-Exam

This was my lowest scoring mark in the entirety of my University experience. 

This piece scored 45%. I Achieved 59% in this module. 

I found the questions ambiguous and unclear. We were unable to ask for clarification, and hence this lack of clarity affected my ability to answer the questions accurately and effectively. Another example of why Exam conditions are an outdated method with ineffective reflection of capability in the workplace.
